The past few decades have witnessed a burst in the high-throughput molecular data sets, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying human genetic diseases. Despite the recent efforts on sequencing and genome wide association studies characterizing genetic variants associated with patient subgroups, most clinical trials fail due to the lack of efficacy and safety. Accordingly, repurposing existing drugs for new uses has attracted considerable attention over the past years. To identify potential candidates that could be repositioned for a new indication, many studies make use of chemical, target, and side effect similarity between drugs to train classifiers. Despite promising prediction accuracies of these supervised computational models, their use in practice, such as for rare diseases, is hindered by the assumption that there are already known and similar drugs for a given condition of interest. In this talk, using publicly available data sets and data-driven modeling, I will challenge such assumptions and explain my recent efforts on interactome-based characterization of drug effect.
